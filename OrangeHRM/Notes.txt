*** END to END Framework *** ( Practice build 2-3 frameworks )
================================

Flat Scripting (Without Frameworks)
-----------------------------------
  - tends to have lot of hard coding
  - hard coding of element finding strategy and locators
  - no reusable code
  - lot of technical code
  - no testing framework integration to create reports
  - lack of methodical approach
  - no directory structure created
  
FrameWork:
---------
  - It is a discipline approach of writing scripts
  - No hard codings
  - Script writing becomes less technical
  - Reusability of code
  - proper directory structure 
  
- test case should not contain inplementation of flow to exercise a business process like login
  so if business process steps changes then test case will have an impact of that change
  
  
Layers of Framework :
---------------------
Layer 1) Test Case ( New Package)
Layer 2) Business logic implementation (Page Objects) (New Package)
	Every Page supports multiple business processes
	In Page Object we create different classes for each page present in application
	and business processes supported by each page gets implemented as separate function in corresponding page class
	create method to call element interaction from layer 3
Layer 3) UI Interaction (New Project -> build jar file and add in to above project as dependency)
	Open Browser,
	Find Elements,
	Interact with elements, etc.
	
Reduce Hard Coding:(Configuration File)(In a Layer 3)
-------------------
- Create Environment Variable file which include
   - path of chromedriver
   - url of application
   
- Write function to read above file provide values as a Utilities

- the location of this file is set to System Environment Variable


Object Repository : (In a Layer 3)
------------------
-This is a folder which conatain a file for every page present in application

  - Each file includes the identification strategy of each element of that page in the below format
     ElementName,Strategy(by id,name,xpath,etc),value
  - store all elements of that page in a hashmap as below
  	 ElemnetName, WebElement
